# Transfer Learning using Tensorflow

### Messy/Clean Room Classification

*Step-1:* Imported the required libraries.

*Step-2:* Mounted the drive.

*Step-3:* Loaded the data. Source: Kaggle

*Step-4:* Separated the data for training and validation in 80:20.

*Step-5:* Preprocessed the data.

*Step-6:* Build the model, added layers. In total it has 154 layers.

*Step-7:* Put learning rate as 0.0001 and trained the model using 10 epochs.

*Step-8:* Plotted the results for accuracy.
